# FaceDetectâ€” Face Classification with VGGFace2 Encoder + MTCNN (PyTorch)

This project trains a lightweight classifier head on top of a frozen **InceptionResnetV1** (pretrained on **VGGFace2**) for closed-set face identification. Faces are detected/aligned with **MTCNN** at load time.

Key training flow:
- **Data split**: 90% train/validation, **10% held-out test** (stratified by class).
- **Model selection**: **5-fold cross-validation** on the 90% portion; pick the fold with the **best validation accuracy**.
- **Final report**: After training, the chosen best model is evaluated on the 10% test set and the script **prints only the test accuracy**
